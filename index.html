    <h1>EVERYDAY GIT</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Git </dt>
        <dd>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to 
            handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.It was Created by Linus Torvalds (the same genius behind Linux) in 2005 .
            Git has become the industry standard for managing projects of all sizes—from small personal scripts to massive enterprise applications.</dd>

        <dt>Version Control</dt>
        <dd>Version control is a system that records changes to a 
            file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. </dd>

    </dl>

    <p>There are alot of other version control systems.They Include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subversion</li>
        <li>CVS</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>
        <li>BitKeeper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However in this blog we will be focusing on git.Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your skills, understanding Git is essential for efficient and collaborative coding.stay with me on this journey</p>
    <h2>Starting up</h2>
    <p>we are going to go through the basic commands used in git .</p>
    <h3>1.Confirmig Whether git is installed</h3>
    <p>To confirm whether you have git installed you run the command <b>git --version</b></p>

    <figcaption>Checking if  git is installed on your computer</figcaption>
    <p>if you have git installed you will see the version of git you are using</p>
    <p>If you go not see a version of git , you can head to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> to download for your specific os</p>
    <h3>2.Configuring git</h3>
    <p>After installing git, you need to configure it with your name and email address. This information will be associated with your commits.</p>
    <p>To set your name, use the following command: <b> git config --global user.name</b></p>
    
    <p>To set your email address, use the following command: <b>git config --global user.email</b></p>

    <figcaption>Configuring git</figcaption>
    <p>These commands will set your global Git configuration, which means they will apply to all repositories on your system. If you want to set them for a specific repository, navigate to that repository and run the same commands without the --global flag.</p>
    <h3>3.Creating a new repository</h3>
    <p>A  Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.</p>
    <p>To create a new Git repository, navigate to the directory where you want to create it and run the following command: <b>git init</b></p>

    <h3>Tacking files and staging area</h3>
    <p>Once you have a repository, you can start tracking files. The staging area is where you prepare files before committing them to the repository.</p>
    <p>Wrhen you make changes to files in your repository, Git doesn't automatically track those changes. Instead, you need to add the files to the staging area before committing them.</p>
    <p>The staging area is like a buffer between your working directory and the repository. It allows you to review changes before finalizing them.</p>
    <p>To see the status of your files and the staging area, you can use the command <b>git status</b></p>
    <p>There is a difference between tracked and untracked files</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>-tracked files</dt>
        <dd>Tracked files are files that Git is already aware of. These files are either staged (ready to be committed) or unstaged (modified but not yet staged).</dd>
        <dt>-untracked files</dt>
        <dd>Untracked files are files that Git is not currently tracking. These files are new and have not been added to the staging area yet.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>To start tracking files in your repository, you need to add them to the staging area. You can do this using the <b>git add .</b> command.</p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image (2).png" alt="">
    <p>The <b>.</b> indicates that you want to add all changes in the current directory. You can also specify individual files if you only want to add specific changes.</p>
    <p>After adding files to the staging area, you can check the status again using <b>git status</b>. You should see that the files are now staged and ready to be committed.</p>
    <h3>4.Committing changes</h3>
    <p>Once you have staged your changes, you can commit them to the repository. A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.</p>
    <p>To commit your changes, use the following command: <b>git commit -m "your commit message"</b></p>
    <p>The <b>-m</b> flag allows you to add a commit message directly in the command line. This message should describe the changes you made in that commit.</p>
    <P>A good commit  should answer the question what this change will do</P>

    <h3>5.Branches</h3>
    <p>Branches are a powerful feature of Git that allows you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously. By default, Git creates a branch called <b>master</b> (or <b>main</b>) when you initialize a new repository.</p>
      <h4>Why are branches important</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Team collaboration</li>
        <li>Experimental</li>
        <li>Version management</li>
      </ol>
    <p>To create a new branch, use the following command: <b>git branch branch_name</b></p>

    <p>To see a list of all branches in your repository, use the command: <b>git branch</b></p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image (4).png" alt="">
    <p>To switch to a different branch, use the command: <b>git switch branch_name</b></p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image (5).png" alt="">
    <p>To create and switch to a new branch in one command, you can use: <b>git checkout -b branch_name</b></p>
    <p>To merge two branches , you run <b> git merge </b>. This will  merge the contents of different branches </p>
   
    <p>To delete a branch, use the command: <b>git branch -d branch_name</b></p>
