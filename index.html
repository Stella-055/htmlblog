          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
          designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
          speed and efficiency.It was Created by Linus Torvalds (the same genius
          behind Linux) in 2005 . Git has become the industry standard for
          managing projects of all sizes—from small personal scripts to massive
          enterprise applications.

          Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of
          files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>There are alot of other version control systems.They Include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subversion</li>
        <li>CVS</li>
        <li>Mercurial</li>

        However in this blog we will be focusing on git.Whether you're just
        starting out or looking to refine your skills, understanding Git is
        essential for efficient and collaborative coding.stay with me on this

    <h2>STARTING UP</h2>
    <p>we are going to go through the basic commands used in git .</p>
    <h3>1.Confirmig Whether git is installed</h3>
    <p>
      To confirm whether you have git installed you run the command
      <b>git --version</b>
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/image.png" alt="checking git version" />
    <figcaption>Checking if git is installed on your computer</figcaption>
    <p>
      if you have git installed you will see the version of git you are using
    </p>
    <p>
      If you go not see a version of git , you can head to
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> to download for your specific os
    </p>
   
    <h3>2.Configuring git</h3>
    <p>
      After installing git, you need to configure it with your name and email
      address. This information will be associated with your commits.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set your name, use the following command:
      <b> git config --global user.name</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      To set your email address, use the following command:
      <b>git config --global user.email</b>
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image.png" alt="configuring git" />
    <figcaption>Configuring git</figcaption>
    <p>
      These commands will set your global Git configuration, which means they
      will apply to all repositories on your system. If you want to set them for
      a specific repository, navigate to that repository and run the same
      commands without the --global flag.
    </p>
    <h3>3.Creating a new repository</h3>
    <p>
      A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to
      save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new Git repository, navigate to the directory where you want
      to create it and run the following command: <b>git init</b>
    </p>

    />

    <h3>Tacking files and staging area</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have a repository, you can start tracking files. The staging area
      is where you prepare files before committing them to the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrhen you make changes to files in your repository, Git doesn't
      automatically track those changes. Instead, you need to add the files to
      the staging area before committing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staging area is like a buffer between your working directory and the
      repository. It allows you to review changes before finalizing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the status of your files and the staging area, you can use the
      command <b>git status</b>
    </p>
    <p>There is a difference between tracked and untracked files</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>-tracked files</dt>
      <dd>
        Tracked files are files that Git is already aware of. These files are
        either staged (ready to be committed) or unstaged (modified but not yet
        staged).
      </dd>
      <dt>-untracked files</dt>
      <dd>
        Untracked files are files that Git is not currently tracking. These
        files are new and have not been added to the staging area yet.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      To start tracking files in your repository, you need to add them to the
      staging area. You can do this using the <b>git add .</b> command.
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image (2).png" alt="" />
    <p>
      The <b>.</b> indicates that you want to add all changes in the current
      directory. You can also specify individual files if you only want to add
      specific changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After adding files to the staging area, you can check the status again
      using <b>git status</b>. You should see that the files are now staged and
      ready to be committed.
    </p>
    <h3>4.Committing changes</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have staged your changes, you can commit them to the repository.
      A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      To commit your changes, use the following command:
      <b>git commit -m "your commit message"</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>-m</b> flag allows you to add a commit message directly in the
      command line. This message should describe the changes you made in that
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>A good commit should answer the question what this change will do</p>

    <h3>5.Branches</h3>
    <p>
      Branches are a powerful feature of Git that allows you to work on
      different versions of your project simultaneously. By default, Git creates
      a branch called <b>master</b> (or <b>main</b>) when you initialize a new
      repository.
    </p>
    <h4>Why are branches important</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Team collaboration</li>
      <li>Experimental</li>
      <li>Version management</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To create a new branch, use the following command:
      <b>git branch branch_name</b>
    </p>
    <div id="branches">

    <p>To create a new branch, use the following command: <span class ="light"> git branch branch_name</span></p>

    <p>
      To see a list of all branches in your repository, use the command:
      <b>git branch</b>
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image (4).png" alt="" />
    <p>
      To switch to a different branch, use the command:
      <b>git switch branch_name</b>
    </p>
    <img src="./assets/Pasted image (5).png" alt="" />
    <p>
      To create and switch to a new branch in one command, you can use:
      <b>git checkout -b branch_name</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      To merge two branches , you run <b> git merge </b>. This will merge the
      contents of different branches
    </p>

    <p>To delete a branch, use the command: <b>git branch -d branch_name</b></p>
